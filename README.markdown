# A Personal Development Boilerplate

This is a collection of technologies that I find useful for developing projects that are mostly client-side.

## To Get Started

1. [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/)
2. `rvm install ruby-1.9.2-p290`
3. `git clone this repo`
4. `gem install bundler`
5. `cd this-repo`
6. wait, wait, wait
6a. While waiting install [LiveReload for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
7. `bundle exec guard`

You now have a webpage based on the HTML5 Boilerplate, using HAML, SCSS and CoffeeScript. Much of the things that I don't foresee using from the H5BP have been removed. Also the H5BP CSS has been replaced with the Compass Twitter Bootstrap.

The generated files have been ignored from the repo.
